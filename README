# Package StatEngPlots
In this package, Gizem and Kim will include some of the basic tools for Statistical Engineering. We will include the Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient Plot, a mean plot and a standard deviation plot. We are also expecting to have enough time for implementing more plots like e.g. the Autocorrelation plot and a standard probability plot.
